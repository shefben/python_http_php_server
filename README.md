# python_http_php_server
A http web server with php support written in python 2.7
This is my (crappy) attempt at a non-standard/custom (i.e. not apache of nginx) webserver that can process php.
it uses PHP binaries, which go into files/php
it requires configparser so do pip install configparser
thats it.

it is not complete. but php SHOULD work.  i focused mainly on POST because that was difficult because i knew almost nothing about http headers and such.


have fun ;)
